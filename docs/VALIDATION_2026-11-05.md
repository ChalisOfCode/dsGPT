# Validation checkpoint, 2026-11-05 UTC

Item 1 is incomplete; items 2–5 remain queued. No release is authorized by this
checkpoint.

- Actual 9B run 41949242982 tested 4b476e0718d90554e1ce91593d06823f8d1e8e62.
  It ended at step 37 with no_progress. The initial app task did not complete;
  generated APK/EXE native checks were skipped. Restart preservation passed.
- Evidence ZIP SHA-256:
  9b6116583f0128b10aa6354ae1ef145f11c5d3a8e82f957b5b7fc44920fd9ee9.
  The original ZIP is preserved separately, not published in source history.
- The last source reads covered overlapping parts of a 3096-character file.
  Prompt assembly clipped source pages even when they fit and omitted the prior
  page of the same file. This checkpoint retains a full observed page when it
  fits, keeps the prior current page, and recognizes complete contiguous coverage
  only when its hash equals the current source. Gaps, stale hashes and conflicting
  overlaps do not suppress reads. Model actions and acceptance criteria are unchanged.
- Routine run 41953848304 on 605bc6dbd1eedc593faadb4e970a868c16114909 passed
  backend, frontend, browser and source audit. Android and Windows native builds
  reached their artifact guards and failed there; downstream installation and
  emulator checks did not run.
- Public artifact inventory (all 100 entries, second page empty) totals 304202442
  unexpired bytes. The existing 300 MiB guard is unchanged. Earliest listed expiry
  is 2026-11-05T18:05:37Z. No artifacts were deleted and no budget was raised.
  Do not blindly retry storage-blocked CI: verify available headroom first.
- This source change is published with push CI skipped to avoid another known
  storage failure. After retention frees sufficient capacity, manually dispatch
  routine CI and a fresh original-request complex-model test on the exact new SHA.
  Neither live test has passed this change yet. Do not rerun an older failed
  workflow expecting it to include the new source.
- Owner hardware and production APK signing/upgrade behavior remain unverified.

Local checks: 183 focused Work/project tests passed. The first broader run passed
1083 tests and 6 subtests, failing only the process-kill fixture: the parent observed
file creation and killed the child before its write finished. The fixture now waits
for the complete effect before killing the child; durable interruption/no replay
assertions remain unchanged. This is a fixture synchronization repair, not a
production crash-recovery success claim. Changed files received manual diff review
and the tracked snapshot passed the pinned Gitleaks scan.
The broader rerun passed 1084 tests plus 6 subtests before the fixture
synchronization edit was loaded; all 15 build tests passed after that edit.
Ruff and diff whitespace checks passed. Archive Actions disablement was reverified
in repository settings; no archive settings or contents were changed.

## Fresh run on 46b6cd9 and diagnostic recovery

- Run 42086380632 on 46b6cd928f08d54fecc5ac7533727dfddca54835 completed
  with failure. Runtime/toolchain setup and bounded evidence upload passed; the
  model stopped at step 30 with no_progress. Native follow-up checks were skipped.
  Restart preservation passed. This is not a completed complex-app acceptance.
- Original evidence ZIP SHA-256:
  bd92625e02fa1e6cce8c7bcc6abf9e9c123495e353631600d5df753eae0f668e.
  The downloaded ZIP matched GitHub's artifact digest and was preserved separately
  before expiry. No source archive, production signing material or owner diagnostics
  are added to this public checkpoint.
- The model attempted to execute a Gradle configuration file, later corrected its
  tool choice, then encountered an unresolved class in a test it had written.
  Subsequent reads of the test, activity and manifest repeated without implementing
  the class. Prompt inspection found that latest execution stderr/stdout retained
  only their tails after the build action left the two-step history. This lost the
  compiler's initial diagnostic while retaining a generic subprocess traceback.
- The recovery change keeps bounded UTF-8 head/tail excerpts with explicit full-log
  pointers and retains failed-execution guidance during source inspection. It marks
  diagnostics as current or old using the source snapshot hash. Successful completed
  tasks keep completion priority. No model actions, request text, fixture app code,
  no-progress limits or acceptance checks were replaced or weakened.
- Public inventory after the run: 50 artifacts, 82542681 unexpired bytes. The
  storage guard passed for this run. The earlier expiry was not a mandatory waiting
  period; redundant artifact copies can be considered after verified preservation.
  There is now room for the required routine CI and next fresh model run without
  changing budgets, storage limits, runner types, retention or cache policy.
- Local validation for this recovery: 108 focused tests passed; full suite passed
  1089 tests plus 6 subtests. The five diagnostic regressions also passed after the
  final conditional-guidance wording adjustment. Ruff, whitespace and static CI
  policy checks passed. Manual review covered all three changed files; pinned
  Gitleaks scanned the tracked working snapshot (about 3.67 MB) and found no leaks.
  This scan does not establish that the entire application is secure. A fresh
  actual-model pass is still required; regression fixtures do not prove it.
